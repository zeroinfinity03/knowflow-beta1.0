# KnowFlow - AI Assistant Platform

A comprehensive, feature-rich AI assistant platform built with FastAPI, Google Gemini, and Tavily, offering multiple interaction modes and advanced capabilities for both online and offline use.

## Project Overview

KnowFlow is an intelligent assistant platform that combines multiple AI technologies into a unified, user-friendly interface. It offers seamless integration between various interaction modes including text chat, web search, document analysis, image generation, local AI processing, visual Q&A, and an interactive drawing assistant.

The application uses a modular architecture with specialized agents for different capabilities, making it highly extensible and maintainable. It supports both cloud-based processing using cutting-edge models like Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash and local, privacy-focused operation using Meta's Llama 3.2 model through Ollama.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Git
- For Windows: PowerShell with administrator privileges
- For macOS/Linux: Terminal with sudo access

### Environment Variables
Create a  `.env` file in the main project directory and put all these api keys in it:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
# Get from Google AI Studio: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
# Get from Tavily AI Dashboard: https://tavily.com/dashboard

HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
# Get from HuggingFace Settings: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens


GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials/google-cloud-credentials.json
# (dont change this path)
# Get the key from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# Download JSON and save in credentials/ folder, first create this folder in the main project directory.
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeroinfinity03/KnowFlow.git
cd knowflow
```

2. Choose the appropriate setup method for your operating system:

#### For Windows:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
.\setup.ps1
```

The Windows setup script will automatically:
1. Install Python 3.11 (skipped if already installed)
2. Create a Python virtual environment
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install uv package manager in the virtual environment
5. Install project requirements using uv
6. Install and configure Ollama
7. Pull the Llama 3.2 model

Note: The script checks for existing installations and skips steps that aren't needed. If you already have Python 3.11 installed, it will skip the installation step and proceed with creating the virtual environment.

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The macOS/Linux setup script will automatically:
1. Install Homebrew (macOS only, skipped if already installed)
2. Install Python 3.11 (skipped if already installed)
3. Create a Python virtual environment
4. Activate the virtual environment
5. Install uv package manager in the virtual environment
6. Install project requirements using uv
7. Install and configure Ollama (skipped if already installed)
8. Pull the Llama 3.2 model

Note: The script checks for existing installations and skips steps that aren't needed. For example:
- On macOS: If you already have Homebrew and Python 3.11 installed, it will skip those steps
- On Linux: If Python 3.11 is already installed via your package manager (apt, dnf, etc.), it will skip that step
- For both: If Ollama is already installed, it will skip the installation step

### Running the Application

**Important Note**: After running the setup script, you need to activate the virtual environment in a new terminal session before starting the application.

1. First, activate the virtual environment:

#### For Windows:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

2. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. Access the web interface at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Subsequent Uses

Every time you open a new terminal to work on the project:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Activate the virtual environment (using the commands above)
3. Then you can run the server or other commands

To stop the server:

#### For Windows:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell window (recommended)
2. If the server doesn't stop:
   ```powershell
   # Kill the process
   taskkill /F /IM python.exe
   ```

Note: The kill command forcefully terminates processes. Only use it if `Ctrl+C` doesn't work.

#### For macOS/Linux:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal (recommended)
2. If the server doesn't stop:
   ```bash
   # First suspend the process
   Ctrl+Z
   
   # Then find and kill the process on port 8000
   lsof -ti :8000 | xargs kill -9
   ```

Note: The kill commands forcefully terminate processes. Only use them if `Ctrl+C` doesn't work.
